## How do i exactly use this?
The default prefix for this selfbot is `b1=`
Due to the inflexibility of this program, you need to directly change the login details to the redis database in the index.js file. (bad practice)

The line we're talking about is located at line 11:
```js
globalThis.redis = new RedisHandler()
```
You can change it to this:
```js
globalThis.redis = new RedisHandler({
	host: "localhost",
	password: "YOUR_PASSWORD",
	port: 6379,
	maxRetriesPerRequest: 15
})
```
Please remember to change the login details.
# Removal of the database custom options information
It's located at the line 20 at the /classes/Database.js file

You can comment it out like in the following snippet of code:
```js
		} else {
			if (typeof customoptions !== Object) throw SyntaxError("customoptions must be an object")
			// cons.info("JRDS: Running with custom options")
			options = customoptions
		}
```
# ending
